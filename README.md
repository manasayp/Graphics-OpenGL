Computer Graphics Assignments using C++ and OpenGl

1. Sphere : 
An openGL program that displays a sphere using recursive subdivision. The sphere is created by recursively subdivide a tetrahedron.  and is displayed as a wireframe object.

2.Robot-Animation :
An OpenGL graphics program with the following capabilities:
       1. Creates a scene consists of wireframe robot in a sport setting. 
       2. The scene also contains the sport object(s).
       3. Allows the user to select pick any object (any part of the robot or the sport object). 4
       4. Allows the user to rotate the selected object with the left mouse button for left rotation
          and the right mouse for right rotation. 6. Allows the user to translate the selected object.
       5. Allows the user to record/playback user input events by accepting the following entries from a pop-up menu or pre-defined keys:
            a. Start/begin recording
            b. Stop/end recording 
            c. Load/read playback.txt
            d. Playback the saved events 
            e. Reset the default positions/orientations of all objects in the scene
            f. Save the current events that were have been recorded to playback.txt

3.BSpline Curve:
An interactive curve design program that allows the user to draw B-spline curves. A pop-up menu with the following commands are provided:
      1. Control point input On/Off.
      2. Control polygon On/Off. When this option is ON, your program will display the current control polygon. 
      3. B-spline curve On/Off. 
      4. Select a control point
      5. Delete or move the selected control point.
      6. Save: Save the current control points to bspline.txt
      7. Retrieve: Retrieve control points from bspline.txt 
      8. Clear
      9. Draw wireframe surface
      10. Shade surface
      11. Texture surface
      
4. Recursive Ray Tracing:
A ray tracing program to generate a creative scene. The ray traced image is saved to a data file for later viewing. Phong lighting model is usedfor computing the basic object color. Ray tracer supports reflection, refraction, and shadow.
